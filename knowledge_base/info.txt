This directory contains the script to build the knowledge base for the project 

We use either sql based database or vector database to maintain the knowledge base 

Following are the pipelines that need to be built: 
- real time asset database pipeline
- real time market trend database pipeline 
- real time podcast transcription database pipeline 
- real time validated information database pipeline 
- overall validated information database pipeline
