Companies leveraging AI and machine learning technologies can provide long-term growth opportunities.

3. **ESG-Focused Mutual Funds**:
   - Considering the growing popularity of ESG investing and the mixed performance of mutual funds, allocating funds to ESG-compliant mutual funds can align with sustainable investing practices while potentially benefiting from the shift towards socially responsible investments.

4. **Bonds and Bank Deposits**:
   - Given the low interest rates in bank deposits and the opportunities in the bond market, diversifying the portfolio with a mix of U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds can provide stability and income generation while balancing the risk profile of the overall portfolio.

5. **Cryptocurrency**:
   - Considering the stability and institutional interest in leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, allocating a small portion of the portfolio to cryptocurrency or crypto ETFs can offer exposure to this innovative asset class with growth potential, aligning with the investor's interest in alternative investments.

### Recommendations:
- **Diversify the portfolio** across real estate, technology stocks, ESG mutual funds, bonds, bank deposits, and a small allocation to cryptocurrency.
- **Regularly monitor the portfolio's performance** and make necessary adjustments in response to market trends and economic indicators to achieve the investor's financial goals efficiently in the evolving financial landscape.
